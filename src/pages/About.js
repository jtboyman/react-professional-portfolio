            Hello! My name is Jordan Boyman. I'm a tennis player, gaming fan, wannabe chef, and full stack developer! Having trained in UConn School of Engineering's Coding Bootcamp, I have experience creating front-end, back-end, and full-stack projects! With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, React, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, and other languages and technologies, I'm looking to leverage these skills and ability to learn quickly to join a team and further build my developing experience.
